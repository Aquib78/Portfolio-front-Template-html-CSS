Setup Instructions
Prerequisites

A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge) to view the website.
A code editor (e.g., VS Code) for making changes to the files.
An internet connection to load the external background image.

Steps to Run Locally

Clone the Repository:git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo-name>.git


Navigate to the Project Directory:cd <your-repo-name>


Open the Website:
Open index.html in your preferred web browser. You can do this by double-clicking the file or dragging it into the browser.
Alternatively, if you have a local server setup (e.g., using VS Code's Live Server extension), you can run it for a better development experience.



Usage

Navigation: Use the header links (Home, About, Services, Portfolio, Contact) to navigate through different sections of the website. (Note: Currently, only the Home section is implemented in the provided code.)
Hero Section: The landing page features a background image, a greeting ("Hi, I'm Aquib"), a subtitle ("Developer"), a brief description, and two buttons ("Hire Me" and "Let's Talk").
Social Media: Click the social media icons at the bottom of the hero section to visit Aquib's profiles (links need to be updated with actual URLs).
Customization:
Update the background image URL in styles.css under the .home class to use a different image.
Modify the text in index.html (e.g., the description paragraph) to personalize the content.
Add more sections (About, Services, etc.) by extending the HTML and CSS as needed.
